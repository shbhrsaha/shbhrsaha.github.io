<h3 id="limericks-follow-patterns">Limericks Follow Patterns</h3>
<p>I’ve been reading lately about how computer scientists are researching the art of jokes. They’re asking the question, “What makes a joke funny?”, and writing programs that come up with their own jokes.</p>

<p>Over the course of this reading, I stumbled upon <a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">these lists of English words</a>. In particular, the “Part Of Speech Database” caught my interest.</p>

<p>Putting two and two together, I thought I’d give auto-generated jokes a shot. I wanted to make something super-simple, not requiring advanced NLP. Limericks fit the bill decently well. These short, rhyming poems follow a consistent structure that depends largely on part of speech and rhyme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know a man with a hairy leg <br />
who takes his drinks with some dairy keg. <br />
Then one day I saw <br />
his head under a claw. <br />
I screamed, “Oh! Does, anyone have a scary egg?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Polly is a Python script I wrote that takes the part of speech database and a limerick template as input, and generates rhyming limericks that match the template.</p>

<h3 id="how-polly-works">How Polly Works</h3>
<p>Here’s how an example template file looks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know a man with a @A !N <br />
who takes his drinks with some @A !N. <br />
Then one day I saw <br />
his head under a claw. <br />
I screamed, “Oh! Does, anyone have a @A !N?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you’ll notice, this is the template for the limerick presented earlier, but some of the rhymes have been replaced with 2-character sequences of a special character followed by a letter.</p>

<p>Matching special characters signify matching rhymes. For example, hairy, dairy, and scary all correspond with the @ symbol because they rhyme. Likewise, leg, keg, and egg correspond with the ! symbol.</p>

<p>The letter after the symbol signifies the part of speech. The @ words are all adjectives (A) and the ! words are all nouns (N). The POS abbreviations follow the conventions described in the part of speech database. Here’s a sample:</p>

<ul>
  <li>N: Noun</li>
  <li>V: Verb</li>
  <li>A: Adjective</li>
  <li>v: Adverb</li>
</ul>

<p>Polly works by processing the part of speech database to group words with common endings– this is a rudimentary way to craft rhymes. Then, the script parses the limerick template and replaces the 2-character sequences with words from the database that match rhyme and part of speech.</p>

<h3 id="generated-limericks">Generated Limericks</h3>
<p>The results are quite amusing, most of the time meaning rubbish. Here’s a selection of the limericks it generated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mary had a little certification. <br />
She also had a restimulation. <br />
I’ve often seen her little syllabication, <br />
But I’ve never seen her perambulation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know a man with a cheek severance <br />
who takes his drinks with some sleek endurance. <br />
Then one day I saw <br />
his head under a claw. <br />
I screamed, “Oh! Does, anyone have a Greek insurance?”</p>
</blockquote>
