    <h2>Who at Princeton has a web site?</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>I was curious how many students at Princeton had posted a web site and, if so, what those sites were about. Check out the <a href="/static/princeton-web-sites/explorer.html">Princeton Undergraduate Personal Web Site Surfer</a> to stumble upon some cool pages.</p>

<h3 id="student-web-sites-are-interesting">Student Web Sites Are Interesting</h3>
<p>Every student at Princeton University has the opportunity to set up a static web site at the www.princeton.edu/~netid/, where “netid” is their student computer username. In fact, the page you’re reading is hosted on one such site (my netid is saha).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago in February 2013, I found myself with a file containing College Facebook data for every undergraduate currently attending the university. With this large list of NetIDs, I was curious how many students at Princeton had posted a web site and, if so, what those sites were about. Visiting student web sites are a cool way to learn about myriad student activities and interests across academic departments.</p>

<h3 id="the-scripts">The Scripts</h3>
<p>I wrote a few Python scripts to ping every netid-based url at princeton.edu, record the HTTP response status, and for those returning a response code of 200, ensure that the content was more than just the default directory listing.</p>

<h3 id="the-fun-stuff">The Fun Stuff</h3>
<p>The final list contained 383 netids whose web sites seemed to contain interesting information. I then wrote <a href="/static/princeton-web-sites/explorer.html">Princeton Undergraduate Personal Web Site Surfer</a> to randomly present only those webpages that were detected to contain interesting content as of March 2013.</p>

<p>I wondered about the breakdown of web sites posted by class:</p>

<p>And here’s the number of web sites by major:</p>

<p><img src="/static/princeton-web-sites/graph2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s expected that Computer Science is near the top of the list, but I was surprised to see Politics, History, and English close behind. In the coming years I bet we’ll see more students setting up web sites.</p>

<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p>The main scripts are available in a <a href="https://github.com/shbhrsaha/websites">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who wrote in:</p>

  <li>Margaret Fortney ‘13 and Peter Johnsen ‘15 add that COS 109 – “Computers in Our World” – would explain the prevalence of web sites among non-COS students. The course is commonly taken to fulfill the quantitative reasoning distribution requirement and features a project where students build personal web sites.</li>
  <li>Margaret recommends <a href="http://helpdesk.princeton.edu/kb/display.plx?ID=9847">this article</a> for students looking to set up their own ~netid web site.</li>
