    <h2>How I organize projects</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>A dead-simple spreadsheet that organizes tasks and shares knowledge for small teams and projects</p>

<h3 id="it-needs-to-be-simple">It needs to be simple</h3>
<p>Throughout my life I’ve needed project management tools, whether it be for a side project, group assignment, or hackathon app. I’ve considered tools like <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. They’re phenomenal. But where they fall short is when I have to get new teammates to use the platform. No one uses it. It’s not because the products’ features are insufficient, but rather fostering adoption of any new platform requires relentless dedication.</p>

<p>I needed a project planning tool that was simple. No registration. No bells and whistles. Just a place where teammates and I can break down a project into tasks, assign the tasks, and share knowledge.</p>

<p>It may not be sexy, but the solution I made was a Google Spreadsheet “dashboard” that my group bookmarks and keeps open whenever working on the project. Most people have Google Drive open anyway, so keeping the dashboard open is usually not much extra work.</p>

<p>There’s two sheets in the dashboard. In the first, shown below, we see the project broken down into smaller tasks that can be assigned to teammates. It doesn’t matter who does the assigning, but that everyone has something to work on. As tasks are completed, the status column updates from blank, to “In Progress”, to “Done”. Conditional formatting along the way makes knocking down tasks a pure joy.</p>

<p>The goal of the second sheet is to share knowledge that may be needed by other people later in the project. Commands, links, addresses, passwords all go here. The key here is to keep the sections meaningfully organized. Think of it like a “corporate knowledge-sharing wiki” for small projects.</p>

<p>It’s surprisingly refreshing to use a tool so simple for project management. The dashboard works best for small, task-oriented projects. You might need a more full-fledged solution to manage processes, CRM, etc. If you’re working by yourself, the dashboard is excellent to keep you on track and saving key findings in the knowledge base.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in using it yourself, just copy the spreadsheet from the link below.</p>
