I write about food, but don't call me a food critic.

Food critics are the experts. They ration Michelin stars and roll steak tartare between their molars. They follow restaurant history, obsess over chefs' careers, and decide fates with the strokes of their pens.

I'm just a guy who loves to eat.

Most of us enjoy good food. I also just get a kick out of describing it: the appearance, the flavor, the mouthfeel. I relish the challenge of capturing complex experiences in simple words. I don't review restaurants. _I relate the food experience_.

I rarely walk into a restaurant knowing that I'm going to write about it. The food has to move me, change my outlook on life. I write only about food that makes me think, _Wow_.

For me, writing preserves the memory of eating a food like a photograph preserves the memory of viewing a landscape.

Life is too short to eat lousy food, and good food doesn't have to be expensive.

I hope you enjoy reading this collection as much as I enjoy writing it.
