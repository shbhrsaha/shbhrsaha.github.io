title: Why I use 'I'm Feeling Lucky' for every search
---

A week ago, I tried a fun experiment.

I configured my Chrome browser to send search queries to Google's 'I'm Feeling Lucky'. The feature skips the search results page and automatically navigates to the first result.

To my surprise, I love it. Searching 'Princeton map' takes me straight to the [official map](http://m.princeton.edu/map/campus), 'python import syntax' to the [modules docs](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html), and 'bent spoon hours' to the [hours page](http://www.thebentspoon.net/BENTSPOON/hours.html) of my favorite ice cream shop. When the algorithm is not confident about the first result, it gracefully sends me to the usual search results page.

Occassionally I use the 'g' keyword in my search bar to do a normal Google search. The results page is still useful for doing research on a topic, for example. With most searches, though, I'm pretty happy with the first result.

It's all still [anecdata](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=anecdata), but I think the productivity improvement is noticeable. 'I'm Feeling Lucky' has long existed as a fun feature. Now, Google's ranking algorithm might be smart enough for us to take it seriously. After all, web searches should be about _answers_, not _search results_.

Sometimes it screws up: 'obama birthday' takes me [The Washington Times](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/7/russians-mock-obama-with-racist-birthday-message-p/). To easily return to search results, I created a Chrome extension called [Lucky Strike](https://github.com/shbhrsaha/lucky-strike). When clicked, the extension pulls up the search results page for your most recent search. You can install it for yourself on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lucky-strike/heijciabceepcblmjfndmmkmacnfniom?hl=en). If you don't mind retyping queries, you can add 'I'm Feeling Lucky' to your search bar the [plain vanilla way](https://coderwall.com/p/062lng/make-i-m-feeling-lucky-your-default-chrome-search).

'I'm Feeling Lucky' doesn't always work. But when it does, it's insanely good.

Give it a shot.
