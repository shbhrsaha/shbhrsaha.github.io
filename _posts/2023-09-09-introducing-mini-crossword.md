<br />

Earlier this year, I wondered what it would take to semi-automatically generate mini crossword puzzles with code. 

Many lines of Python & TypeScript later, I published [MiniCrossword.Net](https://minicrossword.net/)â€” a site that publishes a free mini crossword puzzle to play every day.

It's been fun to work on, and I hope to keep it running for the foreseeable future.
