### How it works

I was inspired by [what-would-i-say](http://what-would-i-say.com/) to create a text generator for the popular Facebook page, [Humans of New York](https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork). I love HONY. Each day, Brandon Stanton photographs interesting individuals and writes captions about them.

I figured: why not let a computer give his project a try? The program above assembles captions for stock photographs from Google Images. Captions are a sequence of alternating questions and answers. Each question and answer is randomly selected from a large pool of dialogue from the actual HONY Facebook page. When put together, the stock photographs and randomly selected text sometimes create amusing results.

This generator is NOT a [Markov chain generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators) because it only randomly selects lines from a database. The results were simply more meaningful with this alternative implementation because many of the captions in HONY are Q&A conversations.

Some posts on Humans of New York cover deeply emotional topics. Please understand that post generation is completely random, and any semblance of real meaning is purely coincidental.
