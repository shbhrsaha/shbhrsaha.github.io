title: Show the case against
---

I often read product and engineering documents that detail reasons for why the team/org/company should do something-- launch a new product, refactor a system, etc.

The question I wish more authors would answer up-front, though, is: _why __shouldn't__ we do this_?

In other words, what's the case against launching the new product, refactoring the system, etc.? Showing the case against is useful for a few reasons.

First, it helps the author *really* think through hard tradeoffs. They may discover a critical drawback they overlooked or convince themselves of another approach entirely. Deeper introspection helps produce a stronger proposal.

Second, it helps the author gain the reader's trust. A well-constructed case against doing something-- coupled with a thoughtful defense for why the proposal still has merit-- suggests that the author put in _some_ work to think more broadly about the problem space.

The hardest challenge is to genuinely identify and present the strongest case against a proposal. It's tempting to present a ["straw man" argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) and tear it down, but doing so is a waste of time. 

The goal should be to present the ["steel man" argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning)-- i.e. the one that lays out the biggest reasons for why the proposal should not be done.

Adequately refuted, such a "case against" makes the "case for" doing the proposal even stronger.
