Or: _How I learned to stop worrying and love reading again_



1. **Read books.**
2. **Don't continue reading books you don't enjoy.** <br />In fact, getting "stuck" in a book you don't enjoy may cause you to break Rule #1.
3. **Give yourself permission to read non-linearly.** <br />Skip chapters, jump around.
4. **Don't read every word of a book just to say you "read the book".** <br />People may ask if you read the book. They won't care that your eyes beheld every word.
5. **Give yourself permission to read multiple books at a time.**
6. **Don't feel obligated to "speed read".** <br />Linger on passages that strike you as interesting.
7. **Understand that no book can please everyone.** <br />Whether you enjoy a book is a function of the book's content and the cumulative sum of your life experiences. The latter is different for everyone.
8. **Reconsider books you didn't enjoy in the past.** <br />See Rule #7. The cumulative sum of your life experiences is always changing.
9. **Give yourself permission to re-read books you enjoyed in the past.** <br />You'll probably remember things you had forgotten or notice things you hadn't before.
10. **Don't worship the number of books you read.** <br />It's OK to record and count your books. But worshipping that number may cause you to break Rule #9.
11. **Understand that reasons for enjoying a book can vary.** <br />*Enjoyment* can be unpacked to mean:
- *"I agreed with the author's view"*
- *"I disagreed with the author's view, but think the book is valuable to read"*
- *"I think this book is entertaining"*
- *"I think this book is interesting (i.e. surprising)"*
- *"I think this book is sometimes interesting, sometimes uninteresting"*
- *"This book changed my outlook on life"*
- etc.
12. **When recommending a book, explain why you enjoyed it.** <br />See Rule #11.



**Addendum**



A few ways to find books you might enjoy:

- Think of an interesting subject and look up related books that others recommend
- Look up books by authors you previously enjoyed
- Look up books mentioned in books you previously enjoyed
- Ask a friend, but see Rules #11 and #12

By the way, if you feel bad about spending money on books you might not enjoy, [consider my friend Satyajeet's philosophy](https://www.satyajeetpal.com/posts/2019/07/10/why-buy-books/): the tremendous value you'll reap from reading the occasionally great book may well exceed the cost of purchasing all the other books you won't enjoy.
