[Sean Ellis once proposed](http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/) a way to measure product market fit:

> In my experience, achieving product/market fit requires at least 40% of users saying they would be “very disappointed” without your product.

This got me thinking about which products in my life I would be "very disappointed" to lose, and [SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com/) came out at the top.

Yep. It's yet another free note-taking service.

For two years, I've used SimpleNote to sync notes between [nvalt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) on my laptop and the Simplenote iOS app on my phone. 

What I love about SimpleNote, though, is it _just works_. It doesn't do more than it's supposed to do. The sync in both directions is blazing fast. I don't even think about it. I forget that it's there.

I tried other apps, but SimpleNote is the only one I found that does this one thing really well, resulting in a legion of die-hard users.

Heck, I would even pay for it if I could.

I should go back up my notes.
