I've been impressed with Stable Diffusion [since it launched last month](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and wanted to lower barriers for more people to use it.

Etch is a little project I hacked on that lets people play with [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream)-- [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)'s hosted Stable Diffusion service-- easily on their iPhones. The app supports txt2img, img2img, and inpainting.

Note: I'm not affiliated with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), just a fan of their work.

There are rough edges, but I think it's usable enough for other folks to check out. If you try it, [let me know what you make](https://twitter.com/shubroski)!
